# Week02 Assignment

Using Photoshop, design your “About You” landing page. Use the 960px 12-column grid template included in this repo as the foundation. Remember to apply principles of good web design. At minimum, the mockup must include the following:

- Your Name  
- Your Photo/avatar  
- ICP Program you’re enrolled in  
- year(s) in the program  
- 1-2 paragraph bio  
- link to your GitHub page  
- a few examples of relevant work  
- list relevant technical skills  
- contact info  

Once you’re done, name your mockup `firstname-lastname.psd` and submit it using a pull request.
